## 📚 Module 3: Apache Spark

Apache Spark is an **open-source**, **in-memory application framework** designed for **distributed data processing** and **iterative analysis** on massive data volumes.

Both **distributed systems** and **Apache Spark** are inherently **scalable** and **fault-tolerant**, making Spark ideal for handling big data workloads efficiently.

---

### 🚀 Why Apache Spark?

Apache Spark addresses the limitations of traditional MapReduce by:
- Keeping a significant portion of data **in memory**
- Reducing costly and time-consuming **disk I/O**
- Enabling **faster iterative processing**

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts

#### 🔹 Functional Programming
Spark supports **functional programming**, a declarative model that focuses on **what** needs to be done rather than **how**. It uses **expressions** and promotes **immutable** data structures.

#### 🔹 Lambda Functions
**Lambda functions** (anonymous functions) are a core part of functional programming in Spark.  
They enable concise data transformations and are executed **in parallel** using **lambda calculus**.

#### 🔹 RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets)
RDD is the **primary data abstraction** in Spark, representing:
- A **fault-tolerant**, **distributed collection** of elements
- Partitioned across multiple nodes
- Capable of **parallel operations**

**Characteristics of RDDs:**
- Immutable and recoverable (ensures **resilience**)
- Can be created from local/remote files, collections, or other RDDs
- Can be **cached** or **persisted** in memory to speed up iterative operations

---

### 🧱 Apache Spark Architecture

Apache Spark architecture includes:
- **Data Input** and **Compute Engines**
- A fault-tolerant **Spark Core**, which:
  - Manages memory
  - Schedules distributed tasks
  - Provides APIs for RDD definitions and operations

---

### 🗃️ Spark SQL & DataFrames

**Spark SQL** introduces a high-level abstraction called **DataFrames** and functions as a **distributed SQL query engine**.

**Spark DataFrames:**
- Similar to tables in relational databases or data frames in R/Python
- Offer **rich optimizations** for efficient big data processing

---

### 📌 Summary

Apache Spark is a powerful tool for big data processing, combining:
- Functional programming paradigms
- Parallel execution with resilience
- Support for SQL-style operations with DataFrames
- Efficient in-memory processing and scalability

---

✅ Designed for scalability, resilience, and performance — Apache Spark is a core component of modern big data pipelines.
